# GUI-Based-System-Monitoring-Tool

The objective of the project is to create a system monitoring tool with a GUI aspect. This part of the project focuses on the backend aspect of parsing the Linux operating system and collecting performance metadata. The tool will track the memory usage and network for a Linux-based operating system. The GUI part will provide insights into computer performance and allow for a comparative analysis of how memory and network activity can be similarly looked at and utilized in tasks.


## Overview
**Software and Languages:** GitHub, VSCode, VirtualBox, QT GUI, C++ programming
**Dependencies:** Cmake, Make, GCC/G++, Ncurses

Tools needed for research were a physical machine, GitHub, C++ programming, CMake/Make programming, VirtualBox, the Linux terminal, additional dependencies, and an IDE (e.g. VsCode as used in the project). The research was divided into five main steps: 1) writing source code for linux parsing and system processing along with files’ header files, 2) downloading and preparing a virtual machine onto machines to boot Linux, 3) installing dependencies (CMake, Make, GCC, and Ncurses) in virtual machine, 4) cloning of the project in virtual machines using GitHub, and 5) recording results and obtaining GUI from ncurses library.

## Takeaways
The memory utilization of a system was learned throughout the course of the research. Skills gained during experimentation were version control system experience, parsing, CMake/Make programming, additional experience with virtual machines and Ubuntu, and learning the different dependencies that make tasks in a command line feasible.
