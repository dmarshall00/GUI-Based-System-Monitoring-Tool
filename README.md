# GUI-Based-System-Monitoring-Tool

The objective of the project is to create a system monitoring tool with a GUI aspect. This part of the project focuses on the backend aspect of parsing the Linux operating system and collecting performance metadata. The tool will track the memory usage and network for a Linux-based operating system. The GUI part will provide insights into computer performance and allow for a comparative analysis of how memory and network activity can be similarly looked at and utilized in tasks.
